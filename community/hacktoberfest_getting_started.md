# üëã Hey Octokit Hacktoberfest friends!

Thank you for being here and showing interest in making this community better and also for contributing to a world wide community of software!

----

## TL;DR

Find an issue on our [project board](https://github.com/orgs/octokit/projects/10/views/9) with a **hacktoberfest** label, make the change, get it merged in, and make an impact in our open source community! üí•

----

## What's this all about?

Have a look at the [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) doc on [participation](https://hacktoberfest.com/participation) - they have all of the details there.  

In the [Octokit](https://github.com/octokit) and [Terraform](https://github.com/integrations/terraform-provider-github) repo set, we've hand picked a whole bunch
of good first issues to tackle and even some really interesting and challenging ones that you can take on during hactoberfest!

----

## Why would I want to participate?

Glad you asked üíñ  

‚úîÔ∏è Like many other organizations and repos that participate in [Hactoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/), the software we write is free to use and provides value to millions of developers around the world. 
Your contributions here will have cascading impacts in software used everywhere! Across the **+70 repos** that we maintain, Octokit and Terraform are used by more that **+4 million** different implementations
(have a look at our repo dependents if you get the chance and you'll see!)

‚ú® Also, you'll get some seriously cool digital rewards and could get an actual üå≥ planted in your name!

----

## How to get started?

If you made it this far, I'm guessing you're pretty serious about wanting to make an impact! 
From out small :octocat: Octokit team and over üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë +2000 developers around the world who contribute to Octokit and Terraform, thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è!

1. **Read** our contribution doc for any of the [Octokit](https://github.com/orgs/octokit/repositories)
and [Terraform](https://github.com/integrations/terraform-provider-github) repos
and checkout the [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) doc on [participation](https://hacktoberfest.com/participation)

2. **Pick a language** or repo that you might be interested in contributing to
Currently, GitHub maintains SDKs for the following languages/frameworks/platforms:
- [JavaScript](https://github.com/octokit?language=javascript#org-profile-repositories) / [TypeScript](https://github.com/octokit?language=typescript#org-profile-repositories)
- [C# / .NET](https://github.com/octokit?language=c%23#org-profile-repositories)
- [Ruby](https://github.com/octokit?language=ruby#org-profile-repositories)
- [Go | Terraform provider](https://github.com/integrations/terraform-provider-github)


3. **Find issues** and needs. There are a couple of ways you can do this:

- We have a public project board where you'll find a [Hactoberfest](https://github.com/orgs/octokit/projects/10/views/9) view broken down by language of available issues
- In all of the repos across our orgs you'll find issues with the following labels
![hacktoberfest](https://github.com/octokit/.github/assets/139819/be5bfd70-32d4-4c54-b622-1289bec5e20a)
![good-first-issue](https://github.com/octokit/.github/assets/139819/fbfb4976-6152-493e-a47f-b584affbcfda)
- You can use the search across the Octokit org for issues with the labels mentioned above
(here's a [primer search for Octokit](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Aoctokit+label%3A%22Status%3A+up+for+grabs%22%2CHactoberfest&type=issues) that you can manipulate to suit your needs)

4. **Make some changes** and get them merged in!  While each community in our collection of Octokit communities is unique and has its own individuality,
we have standard approaches across all of our repos to lower barriers to entry and reduce the friction of getting things done.
Make sure to have a look at each repository's CONTRIBUTING docs above when making contributions.
For more information on how our team prioritizes and responds to issues, PRs, and discussions, please see this document.
